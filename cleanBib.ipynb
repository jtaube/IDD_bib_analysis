    "\n",
    "To goal of this notebook is to clean your `.bib` file to ensure that it only contains the full first names of references that you have cited in your paper. The full first names will then be used to query the probabilistic gender classifier, [Gender API](https://gender-api.com) if over 100 names or [genderize.io](https://genderize.io) if under 100 names. The full names will be used to query for probabilistic race using the [ethnicolr package](https://ethnicolr.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The only required file you need is your manuscript's bibliography in `.bib` format. __Your `.bib` must only contain references cited in the manuscript__. Otherwise, the estimated proportions will be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to analyze the reference list of a published paper instead of your own manuscript in progress, search the paper on [Web of Knowledge](http://apps.webofknowledge.com/) (you will need institutional access). Next, [download the .bib file from Web of Science following these instructions, but start from Step 4 and on Step 6 select BibTeX instead of Plain Text](https://github.com/jdwor/gendercitation/blob/master/Step0_PullingWOSdata.pdf).\n",

    "If you are not using LaTeX, collect and organize only the references you have cited in your manuscript using your reference manager of choice (e.g. Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, ReadCube, etc.) and export that selected bibliography as a `.bib` file. __Please try to export your .bib in an output style that uses full first names (rather than only first initials) and using the full author lists (rather than abbreviated author lists with \"et al.\").__ If first initials are included, our code will automatically retrieve about 70% of those names using the article title or DOI. \n",
